5) 4477468343113002
2003113438647744 - Reverse number
2+ 0*2 +0+ 3*2 +1+ 1*2 +3+ 4*2 +3+ 8*2 +6+ 4*2 +7+ 7*2 +4+ 4*2 - Even position number *2
2+ 0 +0+ 6 +1+ 2 +3+ 8 +3+ 16 +6+ 8 +7+ 14 +4+ 8 - 2 digits sum
2+ 0 +0+ 6 +1+ 2 +3+ 8 +3+ 7 +6+ 8 +7+ 5 +4+ 8 - total
70%10 ==0 then valid

Implement the interface in classes like ABC,XYZ
All classes should have datamembers like empid,name,dept,desg and basic salary
All values should be assigned through parameterized constructor
and data should be displayed using properties.
lÌ¥
If class is ABC , 12% of basic salary of empddkoloyee should go for PF and 8.33% of basic salary should go for PF as employer contribution and 3.67% of Basic Amount should go for Pension Fund from employer contribution.

if >10 years service , 2*basic salary=gratuity amount
if >20 years service , 3* basic salary=gratuity amount
if < 5 no gratuity.

If class is Accenture ,
